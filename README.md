# Font
Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces a new feature, Fonts in XML, which lets you use fonts as resources. This means, there is no need to bundle fonts as assets. Fonts are compiled in R file and are automatically available in the system as a resource. You can then access these fonts with the help of a new resource type, font.  The Support Library 26 provides full support to this feature on devices running API versions 14 and higher.
''Steps:

To add fonts as resources, perform the following steps in the Android Studio:

Right-click the res folder and go to New > Android resource directory.
The New Resource Directory window appears.
In the Resource type list, select font, and then click OK.
Note: The name of the resource directory must be font.
